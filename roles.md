# Roles

This section provides a definition of the various roles we have for a product.
Often a single person may be taking on multiple roles. Sometimes a single role
will cover multiple people. We document them here, in alphabetical order, so
that there is a shared terminology around roles.

These roles have been adapted from a wider Service Delivery proposal.
