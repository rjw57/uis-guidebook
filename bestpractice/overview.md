# Best practice

This section documents current best practice. As we develop products, we find
that some approaches, tools or technologies end up working better for us. These
are documented here.

!> Best practice is often an aspiration rather than a reality. Many of our
products will not follow these guidelines. Pull requests are welcome.

Advice in this section should not be seen as prescriptive. It is not, per se,
*wrong* if these practices are deviated from. Indeed, innovation may reveal a
better practice. This section of the guide in particular should be considered a
"living document".
