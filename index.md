# UIS DevOps Division Guidebook

This book is a living document which is a central place to write down how the
DevOps Division within [UIS](https://www.uis.cam.ac.uk/) work and the
technologies it uses. The way we work and the tools we use evolve over time and,
as such, this book will evolve with it.

As ever, "[pull requests are always
welcome](https://github.com/uisautomation/guidebook/pulls)".

If you are a new developer, you are probably most interested in the
"[bootstrapping](bootstrapping.md)" and "[working practices](workflow.md)"
sections. There you will find information on how to get started developing our
products and how we structure our workdays.
